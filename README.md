Software Design Principles:
1. SOLID Principles
SRP: Each class should have only one responsibility.
OCP: Software should be extendable without modifying existing code.
LSP: Subclasses should replace superclasses without affecting the program.
ISP: Interfaces should be client-specific and not force unnecessary dependencies.
DIP: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should rely on abstractions.

2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Avoid code duplication by ensuring each piece of information or logic exists only once in the codebase.

3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Keep designs simple and avoid unnecessary complexity for easier understanding and maintenance.

4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Do not add functionality until it is necessary to prevent premature optimization and over-engineering.

5. Separation of Concerns
Divide the system into distinct sections that handle specific concerns to improve modularity and maintenance.

6. Law of Demeter (LoD)
Objects should only interact with their immediate associates to minimize dependencies.

7. Encapsulation
Bundle data and methods into a single unit or class, restricting direct access to prevent accidental modifications.

8. Modularity
Break down the system into smaller, independent modules to enhance reusability and manageability.

9. Cohesion and Coupling
Cohesion: Ensure related responsibilities are within a single module.
Coupling: Minimize dependencies between modules for better modularity.

10. Composition over Inheritance
Prefer composition over inheritance for greater flexibility and to avoid issues with deep inheritance hierarchies.

11. Principle of Least Astonishment
Software should behave as users expect to enhance user experience and reduce errors.

12. Design for Testability
Design software to be easily testable by writing isolated code, avoiding global states, and using dependency injection.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
Modularity involves dividing a software system into distinct components or modules, each handling a specific function. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently

 How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
i. Maintainability
Isolation of Changes:
   - Changes in one module have minimal impact on others, reducing error risks.

Simplified Debugging and Testing:
   - Easier to identify and fix bugs within self-contained modules.

Enhanced Readability:
   - Smaller modules are easier for developers to understand and update.

Reusability:
   - Modules can be reused across different projects, saving development effort.

ii. Scalability

Independent Development:
   - Modules can be developed and updated independently, speeding up development.

Easy Integration:
   - New features can be added as modules without altering the existing system.

Resource Allocation:
   - Optimized allocation of resources to individual modules improves performance.

Load Distribution:
   - Workload can be distributed across modules, enhancing system capacity.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing)
1. Unit Testing: Ensures individual software components work correctly.
   
2. Integration Testing: Checks how integrated parts function together.
   
3. System Testing: Verifies the entire software system meets requirements.
   
4. Acceptance Testing: Confirms software meets business needs before deployment.

 Why is testing crucial in software development?
Ensures quality, detects defects early, reduces risks, satisfies users, complies with standards, saves costs, fosters improvement, and aids maintenance.

Version Control Systems:
Version control systems (VCS) are tools that track file changes over time, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on projects by managing revisions, merging changes, and preserving a history of modifications.
